    "**a)** First, formulate a schedule that minimizes the total under-allocation of each department to operating rooms. For example, General Surgery currently receives 48.4% of the total operating room time, and should therefore receive 48.4% of the total operating room time in the new schedule as well. In particular, the CEO has specified that under-allocation is to be avoided, meaning a penalty should be incurred if a department is allocated less than its target %, but there should be no penalty if a department is allocated more than its target % of operating room time.\n",
    "Your model should produce a new schedule that minimizes the total under-allocation (on a percentage basis). The reason for representing allocation on a percentage basis is that using units of time is not equitable: For example, a loss of 1 hour per week is much more disruptive to Oral Surgery (currently 10 hrs/week) than it is for General Surgery (92 hrs/week). Note that time blocks cannot be split among multiple departments (e.g., if department i is assigned to Tuesday Main-2, then they receive the full 9 hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "**HINT:** To get started, index departments using i = 1, . . . , 6, operating rooms using j = 1, . . . , 5, and days using k = 1, . . . , 5. Define the parameter t_i to represent the total number of target hours that department i should receive in the new schedule. Define the decision variable \\s_i to represent the under-allocation of department i (i.e., in the optimal solution, s i should represent the total number of hours below the target t i that department i is allocated). The total under- allocation on a percentage basis can then be minimized using the following objective function:\n",
